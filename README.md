- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Liubov. I am a Software Developer in Test. Last few years I'm working with Java mainly, but I have some experience with other programm languages. 


 You can find here my test projects portfolio. All of them is pretty simple, but have a small pipeline based on GitHub Actions. You can find badges on each repo at readme page to get notifed about last test run results.
 
<!--- Also here I'm attaching the screenshot of dummy bug in Jira. This is my usual pattern of creating them.--->


<!---
lvasileva/lvasileva is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
