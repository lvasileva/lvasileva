- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Liubov. I am a Software Developer in Test. Last few years I'm working with Java mainly, but I have some experience with other programm languages. 


 You can find here my test projects portfolio. All of them is pretty simple, but have a small pipeline based on GitHub Actions. You can find badges on each repo at readme page to get notifed about last test run results.
 
Also you can find the screenshot of dummy bug in Jira [at this link](https://github.com/lvasileva/lvasileva/blob/7ec7c1a45b496d92774c4ce4b45edeedda32e574/DummyJiraBug.png). This is my usual pattern of creating them.


<!---
lvasileva/lvasileva is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
